# Architecture Decision Record

Execution Plan Validation and Metadata Refresh

**Turn**: 2

**Date**: 2025-10-30 - 07:15

**Context**
The execution plan for the Spring Boot MVC JPA PostgreSQL pattern was already implemented in Turn 1. Turn 2 focused on validating the generated project by rerunning the build pipeline and synchronizing the agentic metadata so downstream automation can track the latest repository state.

**Options Considered**
- Rerun the SQL DDL generator and regenerate all project assets.
- Validate the existing implementation, refresh pipeline metadata, and avoid unnecessary file churn.

**Decision**
Validated the existing implementation without regenerating assets. Executed `mvn -q verify` to confirm the service still builds and tests pass, then refreshed agentic pipeline artifacts (session context, turn index, manifest, ADR) to capture this verification pass. This keeps the repository stable while satisfying governance requirements.

**Result**
- Added Turn 2 session context, ADR, project file snapshot, and manifest under `ai/agentic-pipeline/turns/2`.
- Updated `ai/agentic-pipeline/turns_index.csv` with finalized Turn 1 head commit and Turn 2 metadata.

**Consequences**
+ Maintains traceability for the execution plan without introducing redundant diffs.
+ Confirms the project still passes verification after regeneration.
- Future consumers must reference Turn 1 for the original asset generation details.
