# Customer Registration Database Assets

## Domain Migration

Run the normalized Customer Profile migration before starting the Spring Boot application:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/migrations/01_customer_profile_tables.sql
```

The script is idempotentâ€”tables are created with `IF NOT EXISTS` and indexes guard duplicates.

## Test Data

Seed the domain with representative records:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/scripts/customer_profile_test_data.sql
```

The script uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` for safe re-runs and finishes with a smoke-test query.
